### a freecad workbench to estimate material quantity

this frankenstein's monster of a workbench for freecad has been somehow sewn together to work almost as expected. the initial stage displays a selected body's volume rounded up to whole cmÂ³. furthermore some materials are supported to calculate the volume with the materials density to get the expected weight. this estimation enables you to get or calculate the necessary amount of material for additive manufacturing (@100 % infill, ignoring support structures).

i am quite new to freecad and creating workbenches but nonetheless excited.

the workbench has been tested with freecad 0.19

## installation 

it can be installed manually by adding the whole folder into the personal freecad folder

- for linux `/home/username/.FreeCAD/Mod/`
- for windows `%APPDATA%\FreeCAD\Mod\` or `C:\Users\username\Appdata\Roaming\FreeCAD\Mod\`
