# freecad estimate workbench

this frankenstein's monster of a workbench for freecad has been somehow sewn together to work almost as expected. the first stage displays a selected body's volume rounded up to whole cmÂ³. this estimation enables you to calculate the necessary amount of material for additive manufacturing (ignoring support structures).

i am quite new to freecad and creating workbenches but nonetheless excited.

the workbench has been tested with freecad 0.19

## installation 

i don't know if or how it can be found and installed with the addon manager. anyway it can be installed manually by adding the folder into the personal freecad folder

- for linux `/home/username/.FreeCAD/Mod/`
- for windows `%APPDATA%\FreeCAD\Mod\` or `C:\Users\username\Appdata\Roaming\FreeCAD\Mod\`

## license
